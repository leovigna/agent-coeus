# Coeus Agent: Knowledge-Graph First AI Assistant

## Agent Overview
Coeus is an AI assistant designed around a knowledge-graph first architecture for CRM operations. Unlike traditional CRM systems that store data in relational tables, Coeus maintains all knowledge in a graph database where entities (companies, people) and their relationships (employment, reporting) form an interconnected web of information.

## Core Philosophy
The Coeus agent operates on the principle that **relationships are as important as entities**. By storing data in a graph structure, the agent can:
- Understand context through relationship traversal
- Provide answers that consider organizational hierarchies
- Link related information across different data points
- Reason about connections that might not be obvious in traditional databases

## Reasoning Model
Coeus employs a multi-layered reasoning approach:

### 1. Semantic Understanding
- Uses vector embeddings to understand the meaning behind queries
- Matches user intent with relevant entities and relationships
- Handles natural language variations and synonyms

### 2. Graph Traversal
- Explores relationships to find connected information
- Follows paths through the knowledge graph to answer complex queries
- Considers relationship types and directions for accurate results

### 3. Entity Linking
- Automatically resolves references to the same entity
- Maintains consistency across different data sources
- Prevents duplication while preserving relationship integrity

### 4. Contextual Reasoning
- Uses surrounding graph structure to provide context
- Considers organizational hierarchies in responses
- Leverages relationship metadata for richer answers

## MCP Tool Usage Patterns

### Entity Management
The agent uses MCP tools to maintain the knowledge graph:

```
create_company → Adds new company nodes with validation
create_person → Adds new person nodes with normalization
update_entity → Modifies existing nodes while preserving relationships
delete_entity → Removes nodes and cleans up orphaned relationships
```

### Relationship Management
Building and maintaining the graph structure:

```
link_employment → Creates WORKS_AT relationships with metadata
link_reporting → Establishes REPORTS_TO hierarchies
get_relationships → Traverses graph to find connected entities
```

### Search and Discovery
Finding information through semantic and graph-based search:

```
search_entities → Semantic search across all entities
get_relationships → Graph traversal for relationship queries
```

## Near-term Capabilities (MVP)
The initial Coeus agent can handle:

### Basic CRM Operations
- **Company Management**: Create, update, and search company profiles
- **Person Management**: Maintain person records with contact information
- **Employment Tracking**: Link people to companies with job roles
- **Reporting Structure**: Map organizational hierarchies

### Query Types
- "Who works at Acme Corp?"
- "What companies does John Smith have connections to?"
- "Who reports to Sarah Johnson?"
- "Find all people in the engineering department at TechCorp"
- "What is the reporting chain from Alice to the CEO?"

### Semantic Search
- Natural language queries that find relevant entities
- Fuzzy matching for names and company variations
- Context-aware results based on relationship proximity

## Long-term Capabilities (Future)
As Coeus evolves, it will integrate additional data sources:

### Calendar Integration
- "Who did I meet with last week from Acme Corp?"
- "When is my next meeting with the TechCorp team?"
- "Show me all meetings related to the Johnson project"

### Email Integration
- "What have I discussed with Sarah about the Q4 project?"
- "Find all emails from people at Acme Corp"
- "Who have I been in contact with at TechCorp recently?"

### Document Integration
- "What documents mention both John Smith and the Alpha project?"
- "Find all contracts related to Acme Corp"
- "Show me meeting notes that reference the Beta initiative"

### Cross-System Queries
- "Who/what/when" queries that span multiple data sources
- Timeline reconstruction of interactions and relationships
- Comprehensive context for decision-making

## Example User Interactions

### Simple Entity Query
**User**: "Tell me about Acme Corporation"
**Agent Process**:
1. Semantic search for "Acme Corporation" in company entities
2. Retrieve company node with all attributes
3. Traverse relationships to find connected people
4. Return comprehensive company profile with key contacts

### Relationship Query
**User**: "Who reports to Sarah Johnson at TechCorp?"
**Agent Process**:
1. Find person entity matching "Sarah Johnson"
2. Filter by company relationship to "TechCorp"
3. Traverse incoming REPORTS_TO relationships
4. Return list of direct reports with their roles

### Complex Organizational Query
**User**: "What's the management chain from Alice to the CEO at Acme?"
**Agent Process**:
1. Identify Alice's person entity at Acme Corp
2. Find CEO entity at Acme Corp
3. Use graph traversal to find shortest path via REPORTS_TO relationships
4. Return hierarchical chain with roles and levels

## Assumptions and Constraints

### Current Assumptions
- Single-tenant operation (one organization's data per instance)
- English language processing for semantic search
- Company-person relationships are the primary focus
- Manual data entry through MCP tools (no automated ingestion)

### Technical Constraints
- Graph database performance limits query complexity
- Embedding model capabilities affect semantic search quality
- MCP protocol limitations on request/response sizes
- Memory constraints for large graph traversals

### Data Quality Constraints
- Relies on consistent entity naming and normalization
- Relationship accuracy depends on correct data entry
- Semantic search quality varies with embedding model training
- Graph traversal assumes well-connected data

## Success Metrics
The Coeus agent's effectiveness is measured by:

### Accuracy Metrics
- Correct entity identification rate (>95%)
- Relationship traversal accuracy (>90%)
- Semantic search relevance scores (>0.8)

### Performance Metrics
- Query response time (<500ms for typical queries)
- Graph traversal efficiency (max 3 hops for most queries)
- Memory usage during complex operations

### User Experience Metrics
- Natural language query understanding rate
- Successful task completion rate
- Reduction in manual CRM data lookup time

## Integration Philosophy
Coeus is designed to be the **single source of truth** for relationship data while integrating with existing systems as **context providers**. The graph becomes the central nervous system that connects disparate data sources, enabling the agent to provide comprehensive, relationship-aware responses to user queries.

The agent doesn't replace existing tools but rather provides an intelligent layer that understands how all the pieces fit together, making it easier for users to find information and understand the connections that matter for their work.
