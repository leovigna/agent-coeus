# Zep MCP Tools

MCP Tool Wrappers for [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/) graph database.

These tools are designed to be usable with [MCP Typescript SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) but could also support any similar SDK with a similar SDK.

The purpose of this package is to keep the implementation of tools modular:
- Easy to integrate into any custom MCP server
- Limited dependencies are marked as `peerDependencies` to keep things flexible
