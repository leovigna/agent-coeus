# SDK/Library Usage Workflow

1.  **Identify SDK:** Recognize that a task requires using a specific SDK or library.
2.  **Initial Research:** Check for existing documentation, examples, or `README.md` files.
3.  **Repomix (if needed):** If documentation is insufficient or errors occur, use `repomix` with the correct, canonical URL to fetch the source code.
4.  **Analyze API:** Study the API to understand its correct usage, entry points, and required parameters.
5.  **Implement:** Write the code based on the understanding gained from the documentation or source code, choosing the simplest effective implementation.
