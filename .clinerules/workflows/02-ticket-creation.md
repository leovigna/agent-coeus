# Ticket Creation Workflow

1.  **Identify Task:** A new task is identified from the implementation roadmap or as a bug/feature request.
2.  **Create Epic (if needed):** If the task is part of a larger body of work, first create a new Markdown file for the epic in the `epics/` folder and its related `tickets/EPIC-$number-$title` folder to store its linked tickets.
3.  **Create Ticket:** Create a new Markdown file in `tickets/$EPIC-$number-$title/` (when ticket is linked to an epic) or simply `tickets/` (when no linked epic) with a unique ID.
4.  **Fill Details:** Add a title, description, epic, complexity, and any related tickets.
5.  **Assign:** Assign the ticket to a team member.
