# Code and Implementation

- Always use the `.js` extension for imports between TypeScript files.
- Preserve all `TODO` comments unless explicitly asked to remove them.
- Do not delete commented-out code or unused variables.
- Choose the simplest implementation that meets the user's immediate requirements.
